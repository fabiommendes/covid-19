This is a Python library that simulates COVID-19 outbreaks. The main focus is on Brazil, but it
includes demographic data about other countries and can be adapted with relative ease. This library
implements the RSEICHA model (yet to be published, we will link the preprint here). One version,
`covid.models.RSEICHADemografic` considers demographic information and the other, `covid.models.RSEICHA`
just uses generic compartments.

Usage
=====

You can run models from the command line::

$ python -m covid.models.seichar

Or, more typically, from Python code

>>> from covid.models import SEICHAR
>>> m = SEICHAR(region='Italy')
>>> run = m.run()
>>> run.plot()
>>> print(run)

Calculator
----------

To serve the app calculator, use::

    $ inv run

Installation
============

Either clone this repository and install locally using `flit install -s` or use
`pip install covid-models`. If you do not have flit, install it using either your distribution
package manager or use `pip install flit --user`.

The model
=========

SEICHAR is a compartmental model with 8 compartments: Recovered, Fatalities, Susceptible, Exposed,
Infectious, Critical (require ICU care), Hospitalized (or requires hospitalization) and Asymptomatic.

It is governed by the following dynamics:

Basic theoretical results
-------------------------

If we ignore the "Exposed" compartment, it is easy to derive R0 for this model. We must, however,
consider the number of equivalent infectious :math:`I_e = I + \mu A`, in which asymptomatic individuals
contribute less to the overall number of infectious than symptomatic cases.

When :math:`S \simeq N`, this quantity experience an exponential growth and we can associate R0 with
:math:`R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}\left[1 - (1 - \mu) p_s\right]`

Using rit tunnel
----------------

After installing `rit <https://gitlab.com/ritproject/cli#installation>`_, config your tunnel repo:

- Remotely::

  $ rit config tunnel add repo https://github.com/pydemic/tunnel --name pydemic
  $ rit config tunnel default set pydemic --path .

- Locally::

  $ git clone https://github.com/pydemic/tunnel ../tunnel
  $ rit config tunnel add local ../tunnel --name pydemic
  $ rit config tunnel default set pydemic --path .

Examples of usage:

- If you use docker and docker-compose, you can:

  - Build the development image::

    $ rit tunnel run calculator development build

  - Fetch the development docker-compose::

    $ rit tunnel run calculator development fetch compose

  - Run the test pipeline::

    $ rit tunnel run calculator development test up
    $ rit tunnel run calculator development test sync
    $ rit tunnel run calculator development test all
    $ rit tunnel run calculator development test down

  - Build the production image::

    $ rit tunnel run calculator production build

  - Fetch the production docker-compose::

    $ rit tunnel run calculator production fetch compose
